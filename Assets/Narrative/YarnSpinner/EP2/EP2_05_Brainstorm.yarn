Ali: Looks like we are all here. Let's get started.

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Player 7>>
You: We got 2 weeks to go before the presentation!

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ali 9>>
Ali: Yeah. We need fresh, innovative ideas!

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ming 13>>
Ming: I've analyzed market trends, and AI integration is gaining interest across industries.

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ali >>
Ali: Virtual reality also has a lot of potential.

You: AI sounds interesting, any thoughts?

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ali 25>>
Ali: Can someone explain how it can be used?

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Tony 13>>
Tony: Yes, think about applying AI and machine learning to everyday tasks. Imagine having systems that learn and adapt to user behavior over time.

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ali 13>>
Ali: That sounds powerful.

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Tony 9>>
Tony: For example, consider a recommendation system that learns your preferences and suggests movies, music, or even daily routines tailored to your liking.

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ming 7>>
Ming: That could be incredibly convenient.

    <<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ash 13>>
    Ash: The immersive experiences it offers are mind-blowing.
<<else>>
    <<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Tony 13>>

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ali 4>>
Ali: Immersive experience sounds fascinating, how should we do it?

<<if $BlindsClosed>>
    <<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ash 13>>
    Ash: A combination of stunning visuals with spatial audio and haptic feedback should do it.
<<else>>
    <<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ming 16>>

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ali 7>>
Ali: What if we combine virtual reality with AI? 

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ash 7>>
Ash: Like a AI-powered virtual workspace maybe.

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ali 9>>
Ali: Maybe it adapts based on team needs?

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Player 16>>
You: That sounds innovative. How feasible is that technically?

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ming 16>>
Ming: And what about data privacy?

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ali 2>>
Ali: Tony any thoughts?

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Tony 13>>
Tony: It's challenging but doable.

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Tony 7>>
Tony: Machine learning can be used for workspace adaptation based on user behavior and preferences.

Tony: As for data security, end-to-end encryption and strict access controls can be implemented to protect sensitive information.

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ming 25>>
Ming: What about scalability?

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Tony 4>>
Tony: We can leverage cloud computing for scalability, accommodating a large number of users without compromising performance.

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Player 13>>
You: That is excellent. Thanks, Tony!

Ali: What if we combine immersive virtual reality with AI. 

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ash 29>>
Ash: I think... 

Ming: Well, VR and AI does sound promising.

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ash 30>>
Ash: Uh...yes. Like virtual reality...working environment something.

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ming 2>>
Ming: Like a virtual workspace? Sounds cool

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Player 10>>
You: How do we enhance user engagement? It needs to be visually appealing.

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ali 7>>
Ali: Ofcourse! Ash, can guide us through design challenges. Any thoughts?

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ash 30>>
Ash: Well... user-friendly interface?

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Tony 4>>
Tony: Certainly, and also frictionless if I may add. Do you have any more thoughts on the user interface?

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ali 29>>
Ash: Yes design is important... anything else on the tech side?

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Tony 13>>
Tony: It's challenging but doable.

Tony: Let's use Machine learning to adapt a workspace to the users behavior. For security, end-to-end encryption and strict access controls.

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ming 25>>
Ming: That sounds promising, and scalability?

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Tony 4>>
Tony: We can leverage cloud computing. Handles many users without performance issues.

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Player 13>>
You: That is excellent. Thanks, Tony!

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ali 13>>
Ali: That's an excellent approach, Tony!

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ali 13>>
Ali: This morning I got a new project that could use your expertise.

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ali 7>>
Ali: Imagine - “Interactive Virtual Museums with AI Guides”

Ali: It's quite urgent. I'll inform the client that you're on board, but it has a tight deadline.

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Tony 31>>
Tony: That is too abrupt. I'll need to understand the specifics and see how it fits with my current workload.

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Ali 17>>
Ali: Tony. We'll discuss this later. For now, let's continue.

<<PlayAnimation GlobalAnimationController Tony 19>>
Tony: Ok...
